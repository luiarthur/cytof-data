- `cb_raw.csv`
    - Raw expression levels for the CB data.
    - Each column represents a marker, except the `sample_id` column
      represents the sample id.
- `cb_cutoffs.csv`
    - Cutoff values for each sample, by marker. These values
      are generated by the CyTOF machine.
- `cb_transformed.csv`
    - Transformed expression levels. The transformation is
      `y_inj = \log(\tilde{y_inj} / c_ij)`, as explained in the paper.
- `sample_names.txt`
    - Names of the samples (according the `sample_id`)
